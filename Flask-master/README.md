## Introduction:

Within a couple of months, the coronavirus outbreak has gone from a niche item of global health news to the story of our time. Of course, there are thousands of sub-stories underneath the overwhelming umbrella of COVID-19.

We have chosen to focus on the reactions of three major markets to the pandemic. In order to make the most relevant comparisons, we have chosen the financial indices associated with three countries experiencing and responding to the outbreak in divergent ways.

We will focus on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (United States of America), the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index (United Kingdom), and the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (South Korea).

## Covid-19 & Stocks Map

The colors of the circles represent financial loss categories. Red indicates losses of over 20% in the last month. Yellow indicates losses between 10-20%. Green indicates losses under 10%. Click on the circles to see more information on the focus countries.

## Observations

These charts show unanimous financial index losses since the beginning of each country's Covid-19 outbreak. From 3/2/20 to 4/2/20, the Dow Jones and the FTSE lost 24% and 23% respectively, while the KOSPI only lost about 16%. In the United States, losses of 20% from the peak of the index are the sign of a bear market, and potential recession.

Many factors contribute to the fluctuation of the stock market aside from the volume of cases. For instance, major government announcements and initiatives (or lack thereof) have coincided with rapid market activity.

While we cannot assign causality, it appears as though South Korea, which took early, aggressive steps to stem the tide of the virus, has suffered substantially lower financial losses compared to the UK & the US. Just last week, the United States passed China & Italy as the country with the most confirmed infections.
